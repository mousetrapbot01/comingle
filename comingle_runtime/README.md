Edmund S. L. Lam (sllam@qatar.cmu.edu) 

* This implementation was made possible by an JSREP grant (JSREP 4-003-2-001, Effective Distributed 
Programming via Join Patterns with Guards, Propagation and More) from the Qatar National Research Fund 
(a member of the Qatar Foundation).

Contents
========

This folder contains the CoMingle Android runtime system. The folder 'old' contains a soon to be
deprecated version of the runtime, while 'refined' contains the latest and greatest version. In
the 'refined' folder, you will find:

   - Ready to use jars for the CoMingle runtime, just plug it into your android application lib folder and start CoMingling!
   - Source codes of the runtime. The sources are broken up into four eclipse projects. Dependencies link should be sorted out
     when you import all four projects. However, you will have to fix the external Android library links: point to your SDK's
     android.jar and android-support-v4.jar files.

Documentations
==============

Coming soon! Sorry, we are working on it now. For now, please visit https://github.com/sllam/comingle/tree/master/android_apps/CoMingleDragRacingRefined for an example on how to integrate CoMingle with your very own distributed Android app.
