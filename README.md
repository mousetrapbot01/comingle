CoMingle: Decentralized Mobile Programming Language
by Edmund S. L. Lam and Nabeeha Fatima

Edmund S. L. Lam   sllam@qatar.cmu.edu

* This implementation was made possible by an JSREP grant (JSREP 4-003-2-001, Effective Distributed 
Programming via Join Patterns with Guards, Propagation and More) from the Qatar National Research Fund 
(a member of the Qatar Foundation).

Notes
=====

This is the first release of the prototype of CoMingle. Unfortunately, it is currently in a
difficult to use state. We are working hard to make it.. well, much more easily 'makeable'. 
But if you do not have the patience to wait for updates here and really want to run CoMingle
on your local dev environment, feel free to email us for installation assistance.
