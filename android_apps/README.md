CoMingle Apps
=============

This Repository contains toy Android applications, orchestrated by CoMingle.

Basic Requirements
==================

To run this apps, you'll need the following:
  - At least one Android device running Android Lollipop
  - At least two Anroid device, each supporting Wifi-direct connections

I have tested these apps on 2 Nexus 4's running Android Lollipop, and 
2 Samsung Galaxy S4's running Android KitKat. For now, the current network 
middleware only supports Wifi-direct.

Using the Apps
==============

To use these apps, you can either setup the eclipse project found in each subfolder
of the repository, or install the Android .apk file directly into your mobile. 

Once you have one of the apps installed in a few of your mobile devices, you must
establish a Wifi-direct group. To do this, use the Wifi-direct menu in your
'settings' and connect all your participating mobile devices to one, designated as 
the group owner.

** Note: Currently, the group owner must be running Android Lollipop, otherwise the
app's might not work well.. =( I'm not entirely sure why yet, but I'm working hard to
fix it!

Once you have established the Wifi-direct connection, you can run the app on each of
your devices, and start playing!

Note
====

CoMingle is still work in progress, so please do forgive me for the lack of
documentations and the little bugs that you may experience will trying these apps.
I will be work my best to improve this prototype. Please email me at
sllam@qatar.cmu.edu if you wish to report a bug, or encounter any problems while
running the apps.

Also, my apologies if you find the apps stylistically unappealing.. =P they were
implemented and conceived by a CS major with a PhD, with no design training,
hardly any flare in fine arts, or even basic color sense.. =( If you feel you can 
help with ideas or contribute in the development of more CoMingle powered apps, please 
do contact me, I definitely could use the help! =)

Disclaimer
==========

These apps have been tested on 2 Nexus 4's running Android Lollipop, and 2 Samsung
Galaxy S4's running Android KitKat. While I'm pretty certain that they are harmless, 
neither are they intended to do any form of harm to yourself or your mobile device. 
However, I cannot be liable for any freak accidents that occur while you are running 
these apps. So please be cautious while using them. 

And don't use your mobile devices while driving or operating heavy machinery.
